Hi! I am Donghan Yu, a senior researcher at Microsoft. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University.
