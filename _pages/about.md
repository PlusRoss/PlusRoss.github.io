Hi! I am Donghan Yu, a Researcher on the Apple Foundation Model team. Previously, I worked at Microsoft GenAI.

I earned my Ph.D. from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (2018–2023), where I was advised by Prof. [Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University (2014–2018).

During my studies, I also completed research internships at Microsoft Research (mentored by [Chenguang Zhu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chezhu/)) and the Amazon AWS AI Lab (mentored by [Patrick Ng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K69RKB8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Zhiguo Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WrH8uksAAAAJ&hl=en)).
